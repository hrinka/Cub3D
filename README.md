# Cub3D
The goal of cub3d is to make something using raycasting (like Wolfenstein 3D).

## Prerequisites
The project runs using the MiniLibX, a simplified version of the Xlib. It can therefore only run in MacOSX, preferably on a computer with a solid CPU !

## The game
Just like B.J. Blazkowicz in Wolfenstein 3D, you have infiltrated a nazi stronghold.

You got what you needed, but you won't get out unnoticed. You're gonna have to fight your way out !

You should be able to survive if you get to the third floor, and kill everyone there. Good luck !
